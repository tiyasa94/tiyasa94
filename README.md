### I'm Tiyasa!
I am currently preparing myself to build a strong knowledge-base on Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. I am learning about different statistical tools to analyse data in a better way, as well as I am practiciing hands-on machine learning and deep learning techniques in different domains like natural language processing, image classification and so forth. I am looking forward to apply my domain knowledge on various real world problems as it introduces more challenges to work with.
